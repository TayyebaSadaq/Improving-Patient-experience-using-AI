## 📥 Importing the dataset needed for the project:
For developing the code I worked with PVS 1 from the linked dataset below in order to keep development smooth and working with smaller dataset for the models first before later explanding to the full dataset.

## 🧮 Dataset:
the dataset used for this project is the PVS dataset from the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jefmenegazzo/pvs-passive-vehicular-sensors-datasets

From this, the following files were used and will be used for the other PVS datasets:
- dataset_lables.csv
- dataset_gps.csv
- dataset_mpu_left.csv
- dataset_mpu_right.csv
- dataset_gps_mpu_left.csv
- dataset_gps_mpu_right.csv

## 🔄 Pre processing:

## 🤖 Models:

## 🤝 Main:


## 📂 File structure:
1. **preprocessing.py**: This file contains the code for pre-processing the dataset.
2. **model.py**: This file contains the code for training the models and making predictions.
3. **main.py**: This file contains the main function that runs the code.

## How to run the code:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```
