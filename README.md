# ðŸŒŸ Improving Patient Experience Using AI:
Goal: AI solution predicting patients at risk of clinical deterioration based on healthcare data
-> recovery_time used as proxy indicator
--> models aim to support early intervention, improve patient safety and enhance patient overall experience.

## ðŸ§® Dataset:
the dataset used for this project is from the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smmmmmmmmmmmm/synthetic-dataset-for-ai-in-healthcare

## ðŸ©º TARGET VARIABLE: 
the target variable needs to be created given there is no variable for 'risk'. To do this, we use the 'recovery_time' variable as a proxy indicator for risk as seen here
``` python
data['At_Risk'] = data['Recovery_Time'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x > 5 else 0)
```

where 1 indicates the patient is at risk and 0 indicates the patient is not at risk.
The patient is classified as 'At_Risk' if their recovery time is greater than 5 days. A simple, effective way to identify patients who may require additional monitoring or intervention.

## ðŸ“‚ File structure:
1. **preprocessing.py**: This file contains the code for pre-processing the dataset.
2. **model.py**: This file contains the code for training the models and making predictions.
3. **main.py**: This file contains the main function that runs the code.
4. **Improving patient experience using AI.pptx**: this file contains the presentation slides for the project.
## How to run the code:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the main script:
