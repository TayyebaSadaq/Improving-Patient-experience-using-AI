# 🌟 Improving Patient Experience Using AI:
AI has the potential to significantly reduce inefficiencies in healthcare, improve patient flow and experience, and enhance caregiver experience and patient safety throughout the care pathway. For example, AI can be applied to the remote monitoring of patients (e.g., intelligent telehealth through wearables/sensors) to identify and provide timely care for patients at risk of deterioration.

In the long term, AI systems will become more intelligent, enabling AI healthcare systems to achieve a state of precision medicine through AI-augmented healthcare and connected care. Healthcare will shift from the traditional one-size-fits-all form of medicine to a preventative, personalized, data-driven disease management model. This approach aims to achieve improved patient outcomes (enhanced patient and clinical experiences of care) in a more cost-effective delivery system.
